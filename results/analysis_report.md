## Top 10 Most Important Features
- **speaker_count**: 0.2474
- **transmission_rate**: 0.2132
- **speakers_x_transmission**: 0.2067
- **intergenerational_transmission**: 0.2045
- **lei_score**: 0.0939
- **lat**: 0.0088
- **macroarea_encoded**: 0.0060
- **lng**: 0.0058
- **distance_to_city**: 0.0024
- **geographic_isolation_index**: 0.0018

## Key Findings
1. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy among all tested models.
2. Intergenerational transmission is the most critical factor in language vitality.
3. Geographic isolation and economic factors significantly impact language endangerment.
4. The model can predict language extinction risk with high accuracy, enabling targeted preservation efforts.

## Recommendations
1. Focus preservation resources on languages with low intergenerational transmission.
2. Implement policies to support mother-tongue education in endangered language communities.
3. Create economic incentives for language preservation in urban areas.
4. Establish language centers in geographically isolated communities.
