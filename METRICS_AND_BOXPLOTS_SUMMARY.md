## 📖 Understanding the Metrics

### Precision
**Definition:** Of all languages predicted as a certain class, what percentage were actually that class?

**Formula:** `Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`

**Example:** If Random Forest predicts 100 languages as "Critically Endangered" and 91 actually are, precision = 0.91

**Why it matters:** High precision means fewer false alarms, so resources aren't wasted on languages that don't need urgent help.

---

### Recall (Sensitivity)
**Definition:** Of all languages that actually belong to a class, what percentage did we correctly identify?

**Formula:** `Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`

**Example:** If there are 100 "Critically Endangered" languages and we correctly identify 89, recall = 0.89

**Why it matters:** High recall means we don't miss languages that need help. Critical for conservation!

---

### F1-Score
**Definition:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.

**Formula:** `F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

**Example:** With precision=0.91 and recall=0.89, F1 = 2 × (0.91 × 0.89) / (0.91 + 0.89) = 0.90

**Why it matters:** Single metric that balances precision and recall. Best overall performance indicator.

---

### Support
**Definition:** Number of actual instances of each class in the test set.

**Example:** 432 Critically Endangered languages in test set

**Why it matters:** Shows if results are based on sufficient data. Classes with low support may have less reliable metrics.

- **Trade-off:** May include some false positives (precision consideration)

### Balanced F1-Score
- **Random Forest (88% F1):** Optimal balance between precision and recall
- **Impact:** Best overall performance for conservation decision-making
- **Recommendation:** Use Random Forest as primary model for UNESCO's language preservation program
